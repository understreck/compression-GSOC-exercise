My solution for a GSOC interview/exercise

To build, run "cmake -Bbuild" and "cmake --build build" from root folder.<br>
It should print instructions on how it works itself either by itself or if you use the "-h" switch.
The "simple" branch executable just requires two paths, first is in file second is out file.

Everything assumes null terminated string and simple text files.
